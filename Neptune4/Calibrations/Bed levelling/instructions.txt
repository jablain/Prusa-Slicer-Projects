Bed leveling instructions

For fast work use 1/8 bed pattern
For max precision use full bed

1 - Load Project (1/8 or full)
2 - If needed (because of nozzle size) change first layer thickness = About 60% of Nozzle diameter
3 - Pick a filament and if needed change max volumetric speed
4 - Pick correct printer settings (vs nozzle size)

Let her rip

If needed, edit z_offset in Klipper printer.cfg (as per comments) and repeat
