| WHEN USING MAX FLOW CONTROLLED PRINTING |
| STRINGING SHOULD NOT BE A REAL ISSUE    |
+=========================================+

How to calibrate Retraction :

1- Start with Retraction.3mf
2- Select Filament and print settings
3- Set filament max volumetric flow to half the preset value (at the real max value there should never be any stringing)
4- Print the retraction tower
5- Modify retract length, speed and Z Hop to get minimal stringing

Once the optimal values have been set

1- Save the project as is
