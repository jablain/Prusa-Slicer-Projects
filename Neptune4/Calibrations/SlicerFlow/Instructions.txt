How to calibrate Slicer Flow and max volumetric extrusion :

1- Start with SlicerFlowCheck.3mf
2- Select one of the filaments
3- Set it's Maximum Volumetric Flow
3- Print the cube
4- Measure cube side thickness (should be 0.60 mm)
5- If yes increase Filament advanced volumetric flow and repeat test

This will give you for a given filament the max volumetric flow
